1. What is Stan?
 - HMC/L-BFGS/ADVI/...? 
   - memory/cpu efficient
	 - use objective function + gradients
	 - esp. HMC, efficient in the face of high-dimensional parameter spaces and 
	   complex covariances among parmeters (advance over slice sampling, 
		 Gibbs, M-H, etc...)
 - Stan language for specifying objective function (posterior/likelihood/etc...)
   - Stan -> .cpp -> executable
 - Auto-differentiation in math library for calculating gradients of the 
     objective function (so you don't have to!)
 - Amazing mailing list for modeling questions.
 - Interfaces to everything*, with documentation.
 - Well documented API for math library, ok API for everything else.
